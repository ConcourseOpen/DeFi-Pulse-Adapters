## Harvest.finance adapter

The adapter has been redesigned to pull data from [ethparser](https://github.com/harvestfi/ethparser) and then process that data for use in this adapter.

```sh
# Grab list of pools and vaults
curl https://ethparser.herokuapp.com/contracts/vaults -s -o projects/harvest/ethparser-vaults.json

# Process the list of vaults
node projects/harvest/process-ethparser-data.js

# Test the adapter
npm run test -- --project=harvest
```
